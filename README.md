# Vanilla Disable

## Description

This is a quilt mod that allows you to toggle or change many vanilla features
through the vanilla gamerule system. This mod supports the latest version of Minecraft.
Only critical issues/major crashes will be fixed on older versions of Minecraft.
Mod compatibility is an aim but not always a reality - if there is an incompatibility,
I will likely try to resolve it, but my success is not guaranteed.

This mod also rewrites the `/gamerule` command to be much better.
Please look at the wiki for instructions on how to use it.

## Downloads

You can download both stable releases of the mod, and also beta releases, from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/releases).
You can also download stable releases from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).

## Other

The wiki page contains information for development, a list and description of gamerules, more detailed installation instructions,
information about the mixin configuration system, and details about the choice of modloader, version, and feature toggling system.
