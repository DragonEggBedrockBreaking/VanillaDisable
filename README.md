# VanillaDisable

## Description

This is a fabric mod that allows you to toggle or change many vanilla features through various configuration systems. Please see the wiki for instructions on how to use the systems. This mod supports the latest version of Minecraft. Only critical issues/major crashes will be fixed on older versions of Minecraft.  Mod compatibility is an aim but not always a reality - if there is an incompatibility, I will likely try to resolve it, but my success is not guaranteed.

## Downloads

You can download stable releases of the mod from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).

## Dependencies/JIJs/Recommendations

This mod has no hard dependencies, and will run on its own. However, installing [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) will give you a global GUI, installing [owo-lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib) will give you an in-game command-rule-config GUI, and installing [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) for Fabric or [Quilted Standard Libraries](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) for Quilt will remove the requirement to manually enable a resource pack for translatable text. This mod also has a range of libraries included in the jar, which leads to the increased file size. You can read about these in [the wiki](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/wiki/Dependencies#jij).
