# Vanilla Disable

## Description

This is a fabric mod that allows you to toggle or change many vanilla features
through the vanilla gamerule system. This mod supports the latest version of Minecraft.
Only critical issues/major crashes will be fixed on older versions of Minecraft.
Mod compatibility is an aim but not always a reality - if there is an incompatibility,
I will likely try to resolve it, but my success is not guaranteed.

## Downloads

You can download both stable releases of the mod, and also beta releases, from [Github Releases](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/releases).
You can also download stable releases from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).
