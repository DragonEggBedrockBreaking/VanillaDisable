# Vanilla Disable

## Description

This is a fabric mod that allows you to toggle or change many vanilla features through various configuration systems. Please see the wiki for instructions on how to use the systems. This mod supports the latest version of Minecraft. Only critical issues/major crashes will be fixed on older versions of Minecraft.  Mod compatibility is an aim but not always a reality - if there is an incompatibility, I will likely try to resolve it, but my success is not guaranteed.

## Downloads

You can download stable releases of the mod from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DragonEggBedrockBreaking/VanillaDisable/releases) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/vanilla-disable).

## Other

The wiki page contains information for development, more detailed installation instructions, info about configuration systems and properties, information about the mixin configuration system, and details about the choice of modloader, version, and feature toggling system.
