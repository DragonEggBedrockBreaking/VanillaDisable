- Add gamerule `milkClearsEffects` to toggle whether milk clears your status effects
- Add gamerules for toggling enchantment conflicts, including:
  - `bootEnchantmentConflicts` - frost walker and depth strider
  - `bowEnchantmentConflicts` - infinity and mending
  - `crossbowEnchantmentConflicts` - multishot and piercing
  - `damageEnchantmentConflicts` - sharpness, smite, and bane of arthropods
  - `miningEnchantmentConflicts` - fortune and silk touch
  - `protectionEnchantmentConflicts` - protection, blast protection, fire protection, and projectile protection
  - `tridentEnchantmentConflicts` - riptide and loyalty/channeling
- Add gamerule `pushableBuddingAmethyst` to toggle whether budding amethyst blocks are pushable by pistons
- Add gamerule `containerOpeningBlocked` to toggle whether container opening can be blocked by solid blocks/cats

- Make disabling a mixin using CaffeineConfig also disable the gamerule, to not confuse the user.
- Deprecate fabric - adds messages to logs that alert fabric users to the deprecation of the fabric version of this mod. It will be quilt only in 1.19. (NOTE: The unreleased 1.19 branch on the github repo is still fabric because QSL is not on snapshots to my knowledge.)
